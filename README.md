## Hello there! 
I'm Martín González, Full Stack Developer.
I've start at young age, my parents send me to learn an Computing course back in the 80's, where i got my first experience behind a green 
phosphor monitor coding BASIC! I remember to have written a lot of code lines just to see a circle at the screen. But I will never forget 
the joy of seen that circle become an happy face after adding some more coding.
So I was start to take some other courses as I grow up: Graphic Designer at IAC, Computer repairment & Networks at ENDICOTT, Database operator &
Sr VB Programmer at IBM, System Analyst at ESBA, Java 2EE Programmer at UTN and recently Fullstack Developer at HENRY.
